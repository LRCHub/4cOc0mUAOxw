[00:00.05] If I die young, bury me in satin
[00:04.04] Lay me down on a bed of roses
[00:07.10] Sink me in the river at dawn
[00:11.05] Send me away with the words of a love song
[00:17.03] Oh-oh, oh-oh
[00:22.03] Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
[00:26.03] She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
[00:29.09] Oh, and life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no
[00:34.07] Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
[00:38.08] The sharp knife of a short life
[00:45.01] Well, I've had just enough time
[00:51.07] If I die young, bury me in satin
[00:55.05] Lay me down on a bed of roses
[00:59.03] Sink me in the river at dawn
[01:02.09] Send me away with the words of a love song
[01:08.01] The sharp knife of a short life
[01:14.06] Well, I've had just enough time
[01:21.03] And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
[01:25.06] I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
[01:29.03] I've never known the lovin' of a man
[01:33.01] But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
[01:36.06] There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
[01:40.06] Who would have thought forever could be severed by
[01:44.05] The sharp knife of a short life
[01:51.01] Well, I've had just enough time
[02:13.05] So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
[02:18.02] What I never did is done
[02:22.04] A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
[02:27.01] They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
[02:30.06] And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singing
[02:34.07] Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'
[02:47.02] If I die young bury me in satin
[02:50.06] Lay me down on a bed of roses
[02:54.03] Sink me in the river at dawn
[02:57.10] Send me away with the words of a love song
[03:02.02] Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
[03:04.01] The ballad of a dove
[03:07.03] Go with peace and love
[03:10.01] Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
[03:13.05] Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em oh
[03:17.07] The sharp knife of a short life
[03:24.01] Well, I've had just enough time
[03:31.04] So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
